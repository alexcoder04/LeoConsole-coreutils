# LeoConsole-coreutils

A (very) basic implementation of some Unix coreutils (clear, echo, cat, ...) for
[LeoConsole](https://github.com/BoettcherDasOriginal/LeoConsole).

The command-line flags will mostly be not implemented (at least by me). This is
just a very basic implementation. The main point I started this is to have `clear`.

However, if you want to implement some of the advanced features (maybe as C#
practice, I don't see another reason why), I would highly appreciate it. Just
open an issue and tell what you are working on. When it's ready and I have
reviewed a pull request, it will be likely merged.

## Contributing

I am open for any kind of pull requests and if your idea does make sense, it's
very likely to be merged. You can also suggest new features if you want, but
don't hope that I'm going to work on them, remember this is only a tiny side
project.
