# LeoConsole-coreutils

A (very) basic implementation of some Unix coreutils (clear, echo, cat, ...) for
[LeoConsole](https://github.com/BoettcherDasOriginal/LeoConsole).

The command-line flags will mostly be not implemented. This is just a very basic
implementation. The main point I started this is to have `clear`.

However, if you want to implement some of the advanced features (maybe as C#
practice, I don't see another reason why), I would highly appreciate it. Just
open an issue and tell what you are working on. When it's ready and I have
reviewed a pull request, it will be likely merged.
